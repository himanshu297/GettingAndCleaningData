# GettingAndCleaningData
Peer Assignment 

###What the code in 'run_analysis.R' will do (in order) when the script is run:
•	Download Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and store file locally
•	Load dplyr and tidyr 
•	Unzip locally stored zip file
•	Load activity labels
•	Load and select features that include mean or standard deviation Create list of feature names Transpose this list of feature names Make appropriate labels for the data set with descriptive variable names Coerce the proper dimensionality of the feature list
•	Load training data Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
•	Load testing data
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
•	Merge the training and the test sets to create one tidy data set: mydata Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
•	Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject: mydata2
•	Take averages for each activity
•	Take averages for each subject
•	Merge the two sets of averages Make Feature a labelled column rather than row names in accordance with tidy data theory
•	View the first tidy data set: TidySet
